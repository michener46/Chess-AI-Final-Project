# Chess AI Final Project

This repository contains my final Project for the class Artificial Intelligence. Grade Received: A

This repository contains the code for my Chess Game. It currently has bugs with En Passant, which has been disabled for testing purposes.
It contains the necessary code to communicate over the local host to the Python project which runs a server using Flask. 
This has been commented out to do slow run time and to force a different implementation of AI.
I currently use a Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to return the best move based on the current heuristic.
The heuristic currently lacks techniques like forks, pins, etc. and needs overall improvement.
